# LearningRust

A container for all code, playground or otherwise for learning Rust.

After much deliberation about which language to learn and why and how and what direction I wanted to be going in, I settled on Rust for the time being, with the other choices being Python and Zig. Eventually, I will probably learn to use them all based on the problem I am facing.

For now, I believe Rust will be a decent choice to move forward with.
