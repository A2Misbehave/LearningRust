# LearningRust

A container for all code, playground or otherwise for learning Rust.

~~After much deliberation about which language to learn and why and how and what direction I wanted to be going in, I settled on Rust for the time being, with the other choices being Python and Zig. Eventually, I will probably learn to use them all based on the problem I am facing.~~

~~For now, I believe Rust will be a decent choice to move forward with.~~

Ya know how sometimes you let your brain to get too far ahead of you because you just get too far into things and forget that you had a plan from the start? The excitement takes over and allows you to forget the plan itself was supposed to be foundational but not as interesting or fun, and therefore it feels better to think you just jump so far forward without all that foundational work? Yeah, that. Rust on hold. Python for a reason, high performance bits will be 'attempted' on Zig.
